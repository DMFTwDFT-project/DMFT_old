This package will perform DFT+DMFT calculations using free DFT codes (currently it is build upon VASP).
"fortran" folder contains several fortran modules which will be used for runs.
One can compile those modules and put them in "bin" directory.
"ctqmc" folder contains the c++ program for DMFT impurity solver.
One can compile this and put executable in "bin" directory.

Currently we have one example of running DFT+DMFT.
We need several input files including INPUT.py, POSCAR, POTCAR, KPOINTS, RUNDMFT.py.
INPUT.py contains all input parameters used in calculations.
RUNDMFT.py will be executed for DFT+DMFT runs.
Currently, RUNDMFT will run vasp for DFT part but we will update it for other free DFT codes.
